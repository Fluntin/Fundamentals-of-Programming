## Country Information

In this task, you are required to read some data about European countries from a file. The file, "europa.txt", contains information about each country's name, population, and area. The structure should be stored as a list of objects, where each object contains the following instance variables (you can choose the names):

- Country name
- Population
- Area

Once the data structure is read in, the population density should be calculated and stored as a new instance variable using a method. Finally, the results should be presented as follows (part of the output):

```
Estonia            1294236      45226       28.6
Sweden             9515744     449964       21.1
Finland            5410233     338424       16.0
Norway             5033675     385252       13.1
Russia           143100000   17075400        8.4
Iceland             320060     103001        3.1
```

Tips: Place the file reading of the object list in a function and use the `main()` method.
